## A Web Interface for Generating Cool and Realistic Fantasy Maps
When I saw [mewo2's project][notes], it was one of those moments where I was like, "Wow, I wish I had done that!"  Additionally, all of my kids love spending hours poring over Tolkien's maps or maps of other fantasy lands, as well as building their own maps and their own fantastical stories.

I showed them mewo2's page, they were ecstatic; but they only had three complaints:

1. The maps on the page were too small.
2. They wanted to be able to make up their own names
3. They wanted to be able to print the maps out

## Attribution
This is a web interface for the amazing fantasy map generating algorithms by [mewo2][mewo2], who I have never met but can only assume is a genius.  I am using his code found [here][githubTerrain] as the underlying engine for my interface.

He uses this code for a Twitter Bot that creates a new fantasy map every hour; find it at [@unchartedatlas][uncharted]. For his detailed description of his process, see [his page on generating terrain][notes].
