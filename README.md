This is a web interface for the amazing fantasy map generating algorithms by [mewo2][mewo2], who I have never met but can only assume is a genius.  I am using his code found [here][githubTerrain] as the underlying engine for my interface.

He uses this code for a Twitter Bot that creates a new fantasy map every hour; find it at [@unchartedatlas][uncharted]. For his detailed description of his process, see [his page on generating terrain][notes].
